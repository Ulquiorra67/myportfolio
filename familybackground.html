<p	style="color:black;font-family:arial;"><b> My family, are a tight-knit bunch, and we call Quezon City, right here in Metro Manila, our home. At the heart of it all are my parents, Michelle L. Delatina and Rodolfo B. Delatina. They've poured their lives into creating a loving and supportive environment for my younger brother and me, and their commitment to our well-being is something I truly admire. Everything we have, everything we are, really stems from the strong foundation they've built for us.

As the older brother, I'm currently navigating the busy halls of Quirino High School, where I'm a Grade 11 student. It's a challenging but exciting time, and I know these years are shaping who I'll become. My younger brother, Kurt Reign L. Delatina, adds so much energy to our household. We've got that typical brotherly dynamic – a bit of playful competition, but always there for each other when it counts. Our everyday interactions definitely keep things lively around here!

		Our family's story is one of perseverance and unwavering love. We each bring something unique to the table, creating this incredible support system where we celebrate our wins and face any challenges together. From simple family dinners to our occasional outings, every moment just reinforces the strong bond we share. We're a family that believes in hard work, the importance of education, and staying connected, and those values guide us every single day.
