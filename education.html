<p	style="color:black;font-family:arial;"><b> My educational journey began in elementary school, where I attended two different institutions. I started at President Corazon C. Aquino Elementary School in Batasan, Quezon City. Following this, I transferred to Quirino Elementary School in Anonas, also in Quezon City, where I completed my elementary education. Both schools provided me with a solid foundation in core subjects and introduced me to the fundamentals of learning. My time there was formative, shaping my early academic skills and fostering my curiosity.

<br>
Upon graduating from elementary school, I continued my studies at Quirino High School. This period marked a significant transition from the foundational learning of my younger years to more complex and specialized subjects. I was exposed to a wider range of disciplines, which allowed me to explore new interests and discover my strengths. The curriculum challenged me to think critically and solve problems, preparing me for the rigors of higher education and beyond.

<br>
<br>
<br>
The culmination of my primary and secondary education at these schools has provided me with a well-rounded academic background. I have gained a strong understanding of various subjects, developed essential study habits, and learned the value of hard work and perseverance. The lessons and experiences from President Corazon C. Aquino Elementary School, Quirino Elementary School, and Quirino High School have all contributed to the person I am today. I am grateful for the education I received and confident that it has prepared me for future endeavors.
